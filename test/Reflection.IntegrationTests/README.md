# Integration Tests for Reflection

Tests that check capabilities of the **Reprise.Reflection** project in the **Reprise** solution.

## Integration Tests

Only integration tests are used here because other capabilities of Reflection simply use build in
.NET Reflection functions and these are all well tested.
