# Model Generation Tooling

This project provides functionality to generate C# source code for DTOs used for API requests and responses.

The use of DTOs for web API requests and responses is inspired by the [FastEndpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com) project and the [REPR](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern) design pattern.
